        <ul>
          <li><strong>10 July 1856</strong> - Born in
Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1884 </strong> - He emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1886</strong> - Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck.[67] The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain.[68] Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea,[69] they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1887</strong> - Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1895</strong> - The South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition.
          </li>
    
          <li><strong>7 January 1943</strong> - Died (aged 86)
New York City, U.S.</li>
        </ul>

            "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.” “Of all things, I liked books best.” “The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence."
